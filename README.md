## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
Goals is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

## Conclusions
- Based on the final model, below are the top 5 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes
a. Temp = 0.549936
b. Light Snow and Rain = -0.288021
c. Yr = 0.233056
d. windspeed  = -0.155238
e. winter     = 0.131826
- Bike sharing business is gaining increase in popularity over period of time
- Climate play the major role and hence there is increase in usage during summer and fall on an average

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.11.5
- seaborn - 0.12.2
- matplotlib - 3.8.0
